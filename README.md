## Downloading pre-trained models
If you have GloVe models already downloaded on your machine, drop them into the `model-downloads` folder, and skip the
rest of this section.



If you don't already have GloVe models downloaded on your machine, you can run the following command which will download
the glove models into the `model-downloads` folder.
```
./model-downloads/download_glove.sh
```

## Repository Structure
The repository is structured such that you only need to open and run the `main.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.

Run the following, read through the cells and only run them if you have the time, they're rather time-consuming!

### Install pip requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Opening the main Jupyter Notebook
```
jupyter notebook main.ipynb

```

Enjoy!
