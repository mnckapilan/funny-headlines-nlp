## Downloading pre-trained models
If you have GloVe models already downloaded on your machine, drop them into the `model-downloads` folder, and skip the
rest of this section.

## Repository Structure
The repository is structured such that you only need to open and run the `main.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.

Run the following, read through the cells and only run them if you have the time, they're rather time-consuming!

### Install pip requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Opening the main Jupyter Notebook
```
jupyter notebook main.ipynb
```

Enjoy!
